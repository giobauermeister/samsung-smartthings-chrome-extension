# Samsung SmartThings Chrome Extension (WIP)

Control Smasung Smartthings devices from a chrome extension.

Project inspiration: When working from home at my home office, I didn`t want to pick up my phone or AC controller to adjust the AC of the home office room.  
Much better to just open up a Chrome extension and control everything from there.
